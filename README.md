### Simple C++ / OpenGL 2d Game

i created this repo to keep following of what i learn in OpenGL 2d Rendering programming

i'm coding this project like a popular C++/OpenGL game programming live set of tutorials, provided by @Progrematic (youtube channel) 

but it seems that the lecturer of this tutorials has had some lack of knowledge in C++ standard programming and clean code, so i'm refactoring as i learning and coding
